Authz is a backend server for managing authorizations.

An authorization system is a crucial component in managing access to resources and actions within an organization.

The system utilizes policies, which consist of a set of resources and actions that are allowed or denied, to define the level of access that users have to different parts of the organization.

Roles are then created as a grouping of these policies, and users are assigned specific roles using the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism. This allows for efficient management of access to resources and actions based on a user's role within the organization.

In addition to RBAC, the system also allows for the use of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) by adding attribute rules to policies. This provides for even more fine-grained control over access by taking into account user attributes such as job title, location, or department.

This added level of control ensures that access is granted only to those who need it, while still maintaining the security of the organization.

Authz authorization system is a great option because it combines the simplicity of RBAC with the flexibility of ABAC, allowing for efficient management of access while still providing the necessary level of security. It is also a scalable solution that can adapt to the changing needs of the organization. The attribute-based rules can also be used to restrict access based on the context which is a powerful feature for most of the organizations.
